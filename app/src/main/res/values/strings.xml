He had left Kel’Thuzad to rot where he had fallen, but someone, doubtless the necromancer’s devout followers, had cared enough to put the body in a small crypt. The acolytes of the Cult of the Damned now rushed forward, finding the tomb and with effort pushing aside the lid. Inside was a coffin, which was quickly lifted out. Arthas nudged it with his foot, grinning a little.\n“Come along now, necromancer,” he said teasingly as the casket was borne into the back of a vehicle referred to as a “meat wagon.” “The powers that you once served have need of you again.”\n“Told you my death would mean little.” Arthas started. \nHe had become somewhat accustomed to hearing voices; the Lich King, through Frostmourne, whispered to him almost constantly now. But this was something different. He recognized the voice; he had heard it before, but arrogant and taunting, not confidential and conspiratorial. Kel’Thuzad.\n“What the…am I hearing ghosts now?”\nNot only hearing them. Seeing them. Or one specific ghost, at least. Kel’Thuzad’s shape slowly formed before his eyes, translucent and hovering, the eyes dark holes. But it was unmistakably him, and the spectral lips curved in a knowing smile.\n“I was right about you, Prince Arthas.”\n“It took you long enough.” The bass, angry rumble of Tichondrius seemed to come out of nowhere, and the specter—if it had indeed actually been there—disappeared. \nArthas was shaken. Had he imagined it? Was he starting to lose his sanity along with his soul? Tichondrius had not noticed anything and continued, removing the casket and peering disgustedly inside at the nearly- liquefied corpse of Kel’Thuzad.\n\n[Output]\n<entity=\"Narrator\" id=0 line=\"Despite what he had promised his now-vanquished foe, Arthas let him stay dead.
