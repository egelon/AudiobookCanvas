This symbol always marks the start of a dialogue line: \"“\".\n
This symbol always marks the end of a dialogue line: \"”\".\n
Narration lines never start with the symbol for the start of a dialogue line. If a line does not start with the "“" symbol, this means it is a narration line.\n
Narration lines are always read by the Narrator character. They are never read by any other character.\n
Dialogue lines are always read by a character, different than the Narrator.\n
If you see a dialogue line, but cannot infer the character\'s name from the context of the rest of the text, use "Unknown" as the name of the character, and don\'t add a gender.\n
Each dialogue or narration line always starts on a new line.\n
Mark the name and gender of each character at the start of his or her dialogue line. Mark narration lines with the Narrator character. Your response needs to be well-formed JSON. The "character attribute contains the name of the character. The "gender" attribute contains the character's gender. The Narrator doesn't have a "gender" attribute. The "text" attribute contains a copy of the corresponding text line from the input. Here are two examples of the format you need to use:\n
[Input]\nHis face was impassive, but more lined than Arthas remembered. His eyes, however, burned with righteous fury.\n“The dog returns to his vomit,”\nUther said, the words cracking like a whip.\n“I’d prayed you’d stay away.”\nArthas twitched slightly. His voice was rough as he replied,\n“I’m a bad copper—I just keep turning up. I see you still call yourself a paladin, even though I dissolved your order.”\nUther actually laughed, though it was bitter laughter.\n“As if you could dissolve it yourself. I answer to the Light, boy. So did you, once.”\n
